# Assignment Collection : 

This repository constitutes a collection of assignments sumbmitted for a basic programming [Python course](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-course-2024-11) 
at the <br> Weizmann institute of science. <br> 

Here my assignments are organized into folders by the week and shared with other students of the course and  <br> the instructors.
This allows me to get feedback and track changes, review past work and follow progress over time.
